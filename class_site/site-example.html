                        Take Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany‚Äôs, and I hate to be that guy but as much as I adore the movie I‚Äôm fonder of the book. My main reasoning is because is the book
                        she flees never to return in order to serve her own interest, but the movie they have this shitty ending where her and cat embrace Fred and they all find themselves in each other. But in the real conclusion, Holly is romanized a ridiculous amount, and firstly seen as selfish for putting her needs in front of his. 60‚Äôs audiences wouldn‚Äôt accept this original character, I get it, this was a controversial role as it was. Every basic girls muse, Marilyn Monroe turned it down because she didn‚Äôt want to be seen as a floosy. And although it was made for a simple minded audiences, young girls still aspire to playing the moon river on the guitar for a
                        googgly eyed confused 20-something.

                        My heart also holds dearly Daisy Buchanan, firstly because growing up there were no lead beauties who had the privilege of sharing my name, and secondly because I truly believe she gets
                        a bad wrap. She is a self-proclaimed ‚Äòbeautiful little fool‚Äô, she advertises this early on and uses it as her excuse for pursuing her means. It may be abandoning one man for another, one who adores her for one who tolerates her, we must remember this was the 20‚Äôs, she lived to be a wife. The
                        obsession Gatsby developed with Daisy was pos- sessive, senseless and held her to crazy high
                        standards. Just imagine, waking up next to a man everyday who had admired you
                        from afar for years, built their fortune around you, altered their life around
                        you, bought real estate for you. Once a guy bought me dinner and to this day I feel in debt to him. She now has pressure to be the picture of
                        perfection that he has arranged in his distorted pretty head, setting the
                        poor thing up for failure. It's ture she has her problematic parts, but step back
                        and see the lack of romance in this and existence of possession.

                        Last but not least is 500 Days
                        Of Summer title character, Summer. I have a soft spot
                        for Summer but the lazy writing makes me despise her. Throwaway comments like ‚Äú50% marriages end in
                        divorce... like my parents.‚Äù Wow how deep of you and not
                        completely two-dimensional.
                        Summer is the clear villain in this movie and we are positioned to hate
                        her for finding happiness. A stand out scene in this movie is when Tom reflects on mo-
                        ments he saw as golden and sees them not so bright. He has romanticized every element of their relations
                        and distorted his perception of her. Tom‚Äôs biggest strength is that he is played by the ever so adorable
                        Joseph Gordon-Levitt, so it is slightly impossible to hate him but even he has admitted to hating his character.

                        I never really wanted to be this cool girl, and I must remind myself this in my moments of weakness. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm wearing thongs or doc martins, listening to The
                        Smiths or circa 2004 Britney or driving my mum‚Äôs car or a unicycle decorated with flowers, I am not a tool for your advancement. My choices aren‚Äôt put out there for a boy who can barely grow a
                        moustache to pawn and fuss over. Please never describe anything I do as quirky or tell your friends ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really into an alternative
