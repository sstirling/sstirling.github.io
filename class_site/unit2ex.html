<h1>With opioid deaths at all-time highs, treatment beds for poor kids are disappearing</h1>

<p>One by one, residential substance abuse treatment centers for teenagers have disappeared across New Jersey, declining precipitously as the opioid crisis reaches new deadly heights.

<p>First it was Integrity House. Then Lighthouse in Mays Landing. This summer, it was Renaissance House in Newark.

<p>The state now only has two residential facilities for adolescents, one for short-term stays of up to 90 days and the other for longer treatment, attached to the only high school in New Jersey serving children with addiction issues. And James Curtin, president of Daytop Village, says absent state intervention he will likely be forced to close the 70-bed long-term treatment facility.<br><br>

<p>“We’re struggling to stay alive,” Curtin said in an interview with NJ Advance Media. “And if I have to close the Mendham facility, there will be no providers of long-term residential care left in New Jersey for adolescents.”

<p>Experts say if a family has the financial means to send their child to a private facility out of state (residential treatment can cost upward of $30,000 a month), they will likely find a bed. But for those without, state-subsidized beds are typically the only option.

<p>The loss of adolescent beds comes as New Jersey tries to navigate the opioid crisis, which killed more than 3,100 people last year and more than 2,200 through early October. Opioid users make up the majority of patients seeking treatment, and often lack amenities such as housing and health insurance.
