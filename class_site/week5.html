<title>Week 5: Tables and Layout</title>


<xmp theme="journal" style="display:none;">


#Tables! 

Tables are an effective way of organizing a few things, or data you want to compare. They are not, however, ideal for organizing the design on your webiste. 

You'll be using tables to create an icon chart as part of your project, due next week.  

## Table Structure 

The HTML for tables is a good example of nesting. They are made up of several components. 

`<table>`<br>
	`<tr>`<Br>
		`<th>I'm a header</th> <!-- new colum can go right next to it -----> <th>I'm also a header</th>  </tr>`<Br>
	`<tr>`<Br>
		`<td>I'm the first row of data</td><td>I'm the second column's data</td>  </tr>`<Br>
`</table> `<Br>

#### `<table></table>` : The main tag for your table. every aspect of it goes within these tags

#### `<tr></tr>` : Stands for table row. Use it every time you want to start a new row.

#### `<th></th>` : Stands for table header. Use if you want the top row to have bolded labels. 

#### `<td></td>` : Table data. Where the information you want to display goes. 

## An example

<img src="assets/table.jpg" width="80%"> 

#Layout 

<img src="assets/blocks.png">

### Generically, this layers things on top of each other.  

Try dropping this into a new sublime file. 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>

 div {
    background: yellow;
    font-size: 24px;    
 }

</style>
</head>

<body>

<div>
    <p>Box 1</p>
</div>
<div> 
    <p>Box 2</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Box 3</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

```

### But you can change how your HTML is presented
<br>
#### Try setting the width in the CSS to 20% like this `width="20%"`
<BR>
### You can control the layout using CSS 

<img src="assets/layout.png" width="80%">

### Let's make a box using some of this 

#### Delete all the stuff out of the HTML file you've been working in. 

#### Add this as the CSS 

<img src="assets/style-box.png">

<br>

#### Then add this as the body

<br>

<img src="assets/html-box.png">

### What if you want to wrap text around an image? 


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    
    <style>

 img {
 	float:left;
    padding: 10px;
 }

</style>
</head>

<body>
