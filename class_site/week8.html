# Before we get started

#### A full primer on Excel is below. I'm going to try my best not to bore you to death by sticking to it too closely, but I wanted you to at least have it.

# A Basic Excel Primer - Tour of the Interface

## Workbooks and worksheets

A Microsoft Excel Workbook is a file that holds and organizes worksheets (or what most people commonly refer to as spreadsheets). A workbook can hold multiple worksheets of related data. You can rename a worksheet by right-clicking on it ([instructions](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Rename-a-worksheet-3F1F7148-EE83-404D-8EF0-9FF99FBAD1F9?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US&fromAR=1)).

### Columns, rows and cells

### The ribbon (or menu tabs)

The Ribbon holds multiple tabs, with each tab containing related functionality. For example, the Home tab contains quick access to fonts, styling, etc.

### Insert menu, etc.

The Insert tab allows you to add tables, pictures, shapes, etc.

### The File tab 

The File tab is an icon that gives you the options to start and save your work.

### The File tab opens into a different window

The file tab gives you several options to start with templates or opening and saving files.

# Importing data

Although you can double click on a CSV file and hope it opens properly in Excel, I prefer to import it to avoid conflicts and errors.

## Step 1. After creating a new workbook, click on File --> Import

A dialog box opens, asking you the file type. Select CSV, navigate to the file on your computer and import it.

## Step 2. Patience

Depending on the size of the CSV file, it can take anywhere from seconds to several dozen minutes for the data to appear in the worksheet.


# Arithmetic Functions

1. Max - a simple function to find the maximum value.

In column AI, type Maximum value

In column AJ, type =MAX(N:N)

In english:

= denotes the start of a function

MAX is the name of the function that finds the maximum value in a column or row

(N:N) The parenthesis hold the cells you want to include in your calculations. "N:N" means the entire N colum that has numbers in it.

## Hit enter

## Add forumlas

In this data set, we want to find the total number of cases per year for the illnesses combined.

![][2]

[2]: images/4-arithmetic-functions/add-forumlas.png

## Step 1. 

In cell D1, "Total".

We could add the following formula in cell d2 =300+12 to get a total of 312. We'd have to repeat with the numbers in each cell.

That is laborious and doesn't take advantage of Excel's functionality.

Instead, we will write a formula that taps cell locations where the numbers are.

So we will write in cell d2, =B2+C2 to see the total. 

![][3]

[3]: images/4-arithmetic-functions/step-1-.png

## Propagate the formula

For the totals for the other years, you do NOT want to type =B3+C3 and then =B4+C4, etc.

Instead look at bottom right corner of the D2, and you'll see a little box. 

Hover over that box and your white cross turns into a black cross. Double-click when you have the black cross and the formula propagates through out the relevant columns.

# Sorting

**Sorting** sequences your data by a particular order, such as by date, name, category, or by number.

**Filtering** narrows the data you can see to only the categories, dates, names, etc. that you choose.  (see the [filtering tutorial](https://github.com/sandeepmj/philly/blob/master/6-filtering.md))

## Let's start with sorting

## Add levels of sorting

You can add other levels of sorting by clicking on the **+** sign.

If you want to delete a sort, just hit **-**.

## Undo sorting

In the home menu, click on the undo button till you have undone your sorting:

# Filtering

**Filtering** narrows the data you can see to only the categories, dates, names, etc. that you choose. 

**Sorting** sequences your data by a particular order, such as by date, name, category, or by number.  You can [follow the tutorial here](https://github.com/sandeepmj/philly/blob/master/5-sorting.md).

## Step 1. You can find the Filter button in the Home Tab 

![][1]

## Step 2. Click on the filter button and note that a little filter icon appears in each column:

![][2]

[2]: images/6-filtering/step-2-click-on-the-filter-button-and-note-that-a-little-filter-icon-appears-in-each-column-.png

## Step 3. Select which category you want to filter. Let's try column I

Note that all the entries in the column I are in the filter.

![][3]

## Step 4. Turn off "Select All" and then check only the items you want to see.

## Filtering amounts and numbers

Let's say we want to filter the loan amounts so we see only loans between $10,000 and $75,000.

## Press the filter button and click on filter icon on column N (Gross Approval amout):
