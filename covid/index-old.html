Hello from the other side</h1>
<p>
  
<p>Today on a very special episode of Coronaviral.fyi... (Local news after the break)</p>
<p>Sooner or later you were going to know someone who was on self-isolation due to possible coronavirus exposure. If you didn't before today, I've got great news: It me.</p>
<p>After a person at an investigative reporting conference I attended tested positive for COVID-19 (<a href="http://bit.ly/2vcr8p8">http://bit.ly/2vcr8p8</a>), my employer has told me to self-quarantine for the next two weeks. I have no symptoms and I'd be a moderate exposure risk at best, but an understandable bit of caution.</p>
<p>I also want to be clear that I'm in self-quarantine, not isolation. Even though I've been told to &ldquo;self-quarantine&rdquo;, that is a term reserved for people with symptoms. I'm simply being asked by my employer to work from home and am advised to limit public contact. (<a href="https://nyti.ms/2Q6882S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nyti.ms/2Q6882S</a>)</p>
<p>So that's part of this story now as well.</p>
<p>And with my newfound proximity to the virus, I can tell you a few things.</p>
<p>First, I'm human. While I asked for guidance from my employer on traveling until the morning I left, I still went. And once I was there, I did things that from a disease prevention point-of-view, I shouldn't have. I hugged people I love. I shook hands with people. I washed my hands regularly, but I didn't put up any other barriers. And it's because I crave human connection. Maybe I'm primitive for not being able to overcome that, but I'm also ok with it. But to the extent that I may have made virus exposure to the region worse (I live in South Orange, NJ), I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Second, it's frustrating.There very clearly aren't enough tests to go around. I've been told to &ldquo;self-quarantine&rdquo;, but my family has not. I've been told that even if I had direct contact with someone with the virus, I still wouldn't be eligible for expedited testing. I've told people I've come in contact with, but that seems to be about the best I can do. I'll be second-guessing myself constantly for the next few days.</p>
<p>And finally, this brings out the best and worst in people. There are a cadre of people I attended the conference with who are sharing information and offering support. That's truly great to see. But there's also panic behind the scenes and rumors flying regarding the identity of the first positive case (a second attendee from the U.K. has announced they are undergoing testing after showing symptoms) . I've already heard horror stories from people being ostracized and discriminated against in their lives. And that's a damn shame.</p>
<p>Exposure will happen and that's no one's fault. We can't see it. We know very little. But we can support one another.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be a sherpa to this process and will keep you posted on my experience, since it seems like it might be a more common one soon.</p>
<p>Your regular local update is below.</p>
